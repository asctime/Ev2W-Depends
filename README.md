# Ev2W_Depends
<strong><a href="//github.com/asctime/Ev2W">Evolution for Windows</a> dependency libraries (MinGW64 x64) (test with included "gconf-editor")</strong><br>Evolution 2.32 for Windows does not use the Microsoft Windows Registry to store settings. As a carry-over from Linux, Ev2W stores and retrieves settings via a configurable <strong>localhost</strong> TCP/IP connection to GCONF via the GNU DBUS IPC daemon. So, <strong>FIRST install mingw-w64-gsettings-desktop-schemas and mingw-w64-x86_64-dbus from the <a href="https://packages.msys2.org/package/mingw-w64-x86_64-dbus">MSYS2 MinGW64</a> project</strong>. The Gnome icon theme is definitely needed, or the interface will not load correctly. mingw-w64-x86_64-adwaita-icon-theme will also work. "GtkHtml" is required for email rendering, "libical" and "libpst" are needed for their respective Ev2W plugins. Installation of the full GCONF desktop schema pack is optional, but we have yet to pick through everything and determine 100% what is actually still referenced. :)<br><br><strong>DBUS Configurations for Windows</strong><br>
1. Set a GLOBAL SYSTEM VARIABLE for the TCP Address, such as:<br>
DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=tcp:host=localhost,bind=*,port=33445,family=ipv4<br>
This can be any TCPv4 port you want, AFAIK.<br>
2. start (or autostart) the DBUS server executable. There are two options:<br>
"dbus-launch.exe" hides it in the background like a pseudo-service<br>
"dbus-daemon.exe --session" runs it in foreground, useful for debugging<br>
3. Grant any needed network/firewall permissions.<br><br>

<strong>GCONF Configurations for Windows</strong><br>
1. Make-install GCONF <u>after</u> DBUS is installed, configured and running.
2. Once GCONF2 is compiled and installed, edit "/MSYS2/mingw64/etc/gconf/2/path":<code>

&num; This file stores the addresses of config sources for GConf
&num; When a value is stored or requested, the sources are scanned from top to 
&num; bottom, and the first one to have a value for the key (or the first one 
&num; to be writeable) is used to load/store the data.
&num; See the GConf manual for details

&num; Look first in systemwide mandatory settings directory
xml:readwrite:/MSYS2/mingw64/etc/gconf/gconf.xml.mandatory

&num; To read in any mandatory settings that the Sys Admin may have created
&num; prior to a desktop system upgrade. The SysAdmin can stick read-only system
&num; wide sources in this file.
include /MSYS2/mingw64/etc/gconf/2/local-mandatory.path

&num; Now see where users want us to look - basically the user can stick arbitrary 
&num; sources in a ~/.config/gconf.path file and they're inserted here
&num;include "$(USERCONFIGDIR)/gconf/path"
include "$(USERCONFIGDIR)/gconf/path"
&num; Legacy file location
&num;include "$(HOME)/.gconf.path"
include "$(USERCONFIGDIR)/.gconf.path"

&num; Give users a default storage location:
&num; "$(USERCONFIGDIR)/gconf" (or $(HOME)/.gconf when it exists, for backward compatibility)
xml:readwrite:$(DEFAULTUSERSOURCE)
xml:readwrite:$(HOME)/gconf
&num;xml:readwrite:$(ENV_USERPROFILE)/gconf

&num; Location for system-wide settings that are set by the defaults mechanism
xml:readonly:/MSYS2/mingw64/etc/gconf/gconf.xml.system

&num; To read in any defaults settings that the Sys Admin may have created
&num; prior to a desktop system upgrade. The SysAdmin can stick default values
&num; system-wide in this file.
include /MSYS2/mingw64/etc/gconf/2/local-defaults.path

&num; Finally, look at the systemwide defaults
xml:readonly:/MSYS2/mingw64/etc/gconf/gconf.xml.defaults</code>
